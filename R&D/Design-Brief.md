# Design brief for wet lab centrifuges design

## Describe the product's vision
- Open Source centrifuge that improves:
  - The commonalization of components.
- Any entity, org, business with the capacity to build the designs can do it
- We aim to bring production as close as possible to consumption
- We aim to bring also the know-how and the experience to the public domain so that anyone can improve the design
- We aim also for standards to ensure robustness and efficiency

## User group
- Professional lab staff (Scientific labs and hospitals)
- University labs, and University level education.

## Needs
- Access to equipment that is competitive, commercial grade, is the design of a product and not just a hack, it meets the standards for wet-labs, but it is also open source, easy to propose improvements by anyone...
(An open hardware product)
- We need to centrifuge different volumes
  - up to 1.5ml
  - up to 50 ml

### Audience
- Not just users but also manufacturers and professionals related to manufacturing.

### Jobs (Requirements)
- Needs to be compliant with [wet lab requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_lab)

### Pains
- There are already a lot of open hardware projects for centrifuges and users don't know which to use, where to find it.
- The sources and quality of documentation is diverse
- The volume for centrifuges targeted currently in the solutions is for small volumes(until 1.5 ml)
- Not all users want to do a fully DIY centrifuge.
- available solutions are not yet scalable for even low volume production (ideally mid- high volume )
- There is no available open hardware solution for 50 ml
- Active patents don't allow to replicate /reuse those designs patented

### Gain creators:
- Centrifuge high volumes until 50 ml
- Centrifuge can be acquired as a
- Equipment can be acquired completely assembled and in mid to high volumes
- The centrifuge shares components and solutions with other equipment that uses similar components (electronics, etc.)
