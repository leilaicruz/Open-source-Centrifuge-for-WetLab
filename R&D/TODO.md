#TODO: Physical model to determine forces for FEM analysis
- Describe and open the  issue with help wanted label (Jose)

We could design and update an issue, to crowd source it.
- Design the experiment and simulation.
Ideas for experiment: assume certain facts, and data for the model
> The centrifuges rotate at 4000 rpm with certain mass specifications and system behavior...

(Specify simulation scenario).
Consider software like [modelica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mvEUuc-sWE&ab_channel=StrangeLoop) for physic systems simulation.


#TODO:50 FEM Analysis of parts designed depending on physical model
- Big centrifuge design
