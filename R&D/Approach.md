#Documentation:0 Approach to design and development

# Goals of the first iteration
- We build one small centrifuge that kit design ready
- Ready for replication
- High quality documentation
- And reflection on how build the big centrifuge
- 

# Approach:
- Case study: Define design questions and problems based on production system, usage, etc.
  - Use the centrifuge as a case study for open hardware products.
  - An example of a question is: why there are machines with 24 slots if daily use only involves 6 samples
  (For )
  - Includes checking patent infringement as well
  - Study current open hardware solution.


## Next steps design - development
- Define target specs:
  - Based on understanding the usability, scale of use, and manufacturing context.


The motor is the component that defines or constrains the whole design of the product, from a technical perspective.


### Safety requirements:
- Robustness in this system implies that samples are well fixed to the holder, so that there  are no accidents.

- Electronic components must be well isolated so that there are no drops falling into them.
