This document outlines what is expected of the projects and an initial schedule for the teams.


---

During the development of the projects we are going to put quite some emphasis into documentation, as a project is only properly open when its documentation allows others to:
- Feel welcome to contribute.
- Understand the current state of affairs in the project and make contributions.
- Replicate what is being developed and adapt it for local needs/wishes.

Documentation will be done in GitHub. Please make sure you're familiar with its basics by going through any of the many available tutorials online ([ex1](https://lab.github.com/), [ex2](https://help.github.com/en/articles/git-and-github-learning-resources), [ex3](https://git-scm.com/doc), [ex4](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git)).

Moreover, we will be developing scientific tools, which will hopefully reach a state where they can be:
- Calibrated and tested against "traditional tools".
- Published in a peer reviewed journal.
