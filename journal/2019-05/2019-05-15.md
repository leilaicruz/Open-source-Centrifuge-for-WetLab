# Design brief for wet lab centrifuges design

## Describe the product's vision
- Open Source centrifuge that improves the commonalization of components.
-

## User group
Describe the group of users that will use the product. Market segment to which we are going.
## Needs
- Access to equipment that is competitive, commercial grade(is a product not a design, that meet the standards) also open and easy to improve by anyone...
(An open hardware product)
- We need to centrifuge different volumes
  - up to 1.5ml
  - up to 50 ml

### Audience/ Users

### Jobs (Requirements)
- Needs to be compliant with [wet lab requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_lab)

### Pains
- There are already a lot of open hardware projects for centrifuges and users don't know which to use, where to find it.
- The sources and quality of documentation is diverse
- The volume for centrifuges targeted currently in the solutions is for small volumes(until 1.5 ml)
- Not all users want to do a fully DIY centrifuge.
- available solutions are not yet scalable for even low volume production (ideally mid- high volume )
- There is no available open hardware solution for 50 ml
- Active patents don't allow to replicate /reuse those designs patented

### Gain creators:
- Centrifuge high volumes until 50 ml
- Centrifuge can be acquired as a
- Equipment can be acquired completely assembled and in mid to high volumes
- The centrifuge shares components and solutions with other equipment that uses similar components (electronics, etc.)
