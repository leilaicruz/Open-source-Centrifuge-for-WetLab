# Dev plan
- order the closest solution to a commercial kit
- Setting up the requirements
- Setting target specifications
  -


#TODO:20 ## Form for lab to ask questions related to requirements:
(Jose) Document it as an issue in our repo



## Manufacturing contexts and ideas based on scale
- What scale are we talking about, what is an estimate volume, maybe or a percentage of current users, maybe just in the Netherlands.
- What is the scenario low volume, mid volume, high volume? what technologies are best suited. Towards commercial product
- Injection parts are going to be really complicated
- Outer casing could be vacuum formed.


#Test-Ideas: Vacuum forming which can be done in Delft
We can do it based on the kit we are going to buy.
  - Can it be done with recycled plastic? if you have agood stream of plastic, good quality of recycled plastic.

#Test-Ideas: ## Find if there are commercial standard casings that can be adapted
What are the specifications of size, volume, structure, embodiment.
